This project uses github.com/rohanthewiz/element for the generation of HTML

- I do not want to use builder.EleNoRender in this project, rather I want to use builder.Wrap to allow us to run custom logic within the wrapper, so we can ascertain the element's  attributes and render the element's opening tag where it is used in the Render tree.
